# Gongga-3D-Resistivity-Model-Files
Model and data file in this folder are linked to a paper titled 'Mechanism for the Uplift of Gongga Shan in the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau Constrained by 3D Magnetotelluric Data'，authored by Feng Jiang, Xiaobin Chen, Unsworth Martyn, et al.

* All the figures and bigger files related to this paper can be found in a open repository Zenodo at DOI：10.5281/zenodo.7988314 and 10.5281/zenodo.5788041.
* This folder includes the model and data files in ModEM format. 
* The model files in general format are saved in the zip file, in which horizontal slices of the 3D resistivty model are written into separated files and each file comprises four columns indicating longitude, latitute, depth, and resistivity from left to right. A MATLAB script called 'see_slice.m' is included to quickly view each file in the folder.
* All the slices have been combined into one model file which can also be found in this folder.
